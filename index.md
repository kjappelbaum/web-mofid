# MOFid website

The MOFid code has many utilities.  Two are compiled here for ready-to-go online use:

* <sbu.html> allows you to deconstruct MOFs into their building blocks and download the analyzed fragments
* <searchdb.html> runs queries against the CoRE MOF 2019-ASR database of ~15,000 MOFs, in about 20 seconds

Please see the main project [GitHub repository](https://github.com/snurr-group/mofid) for a downloadable C++/Python code.
